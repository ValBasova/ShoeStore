# The Shoe Store

This project consists of five screens:

1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons
2. Welcome onboarding screen
3. Instructions onboarding screen
4. Shoe Listing screen
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe

While the login and onboarding pages do not do anything, the user needs to save the login
state so that the login and onboarding pages do not show again.

The shoe listing page shows the list of shoes and show a button for adding a new shoe, 
while the detail page is for adding a shoe entry. All entries will be saved only as long 
as the app is running.
